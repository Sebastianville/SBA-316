##Inspirational Quotes Display
This project dynamically displays a collection of inspirational quotes using JavaScript. It creates interactive elements where users can click on a placeholder text to reveal the full quote from famous figures like Albert Einstein and Michael Jordan. The page is structured using HTML and styled with CSS.

JavaScript is used to iterate over an array of quotes and generate structured HTML elements. Each quote is wrapped in an article with a click-to-reveal interaction. To explore the quotes, simply open index.html in a browser. Click on a quote placeholder to reveal its content, and click again to hide it. This project demonstrates event-driven programming, DOM manipulation, and dynamic content rendering.


##Inspirational Quotes Form

This project is a simple web form that allows users to submit inspirational quotes along with their email addresses. The form includes HTML validation to ensure required fields are filled before submission. The project uses Bootstrap for styling and JavaScript to handle form interactions. 

To use the project, simply open index.html in a browser, fill out the form, and submit your quote. This setup demonstrates basic form validation.
